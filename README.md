# Algo-Trading-in-R
Algorithmic Trading Strategy, NYU Tandon 11/2016
• Extracted historical data from Yahoo Finance for selected stocks and processed the data to fit ARIMA model in R
• Applied MACD strategy to find trading signals and simulated returns by the historical data to exam the strategy efficiency
• Performed the bootstrap protocol for resampling data, extracted data residuals based on the ARIMA model, and rearranged the residuals to get new series of data
• Calculated P&L and drew graphs for 100 bootstrap datasets to examine the strategy efficiency and modified the model by changing the time intervals of the exponential moving averages
